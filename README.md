# Introduction

This is a personal project build during the react-native course taken with Renan Pallin at Udemy.

The idea behind this project is to build a simple application that retrieves a list of users from an API and display the user's information on screen. There will be a list of available users and a details page with more information of a single user.

We'll be retrieving user information from the Random User API (https://randomuser.me/) and use the basic react-native concepts to display it to the user through react-native components.
